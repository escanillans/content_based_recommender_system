# content_based_recommender_system
The jupyter notebooks will take you through the basics of building a content-based recommender system. 

## content_based_recommender_system.ipynb

This uses a synthetic dataset I created that is a list of book titles related to Machine Learning. The dataset can be found in *data/books.csv*

## recommender_nfl_articles.ipynb

To make things more complicated, I extracted NFL articles from [ESPN's Article Archive](http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/archive). The articles span the following months: June, July, August, September (last extracted 9/17/2018). The dataset can be found in *data/nfl_article_title_data.csv*

You can edit *article_title_extractor.py* to extract the latest document titles and links, if you'd like.
